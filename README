modifying with ec2-user

To run, do the following from the console:
cd game
php war.php

The output from the war game will appear on your console screen

In order to show how easy it is to swap components using interfaces, you can switch the deck of cards that the game uses (I created
an uno deck as well), modify the config/war.ini file.  You can change the deck of cards without changing any of the underlying code for the game.
