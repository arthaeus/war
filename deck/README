An IDeck is made up of ICards

The IDeck is responsible for:

Shuffling.
Resetting (Populating itself with ICards).
Keeping track of its state.
Returning an ICard (Getter).

The IDeck will not be responsible for:
Dealing - A IDeck of ICards can be used for many different IGames.  I think that it should be the concern of the IGame to know how to deal out the ICards.  I assume that different card games have different ways of dealing out ICards.
